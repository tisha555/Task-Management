# Task-Management
The AI-powered real-time task management system enables users to create, assign, and track tasks with real-time updates via WebSockets. AI (OpenAI/Gemini) suggests and automates task breakdowns. Built with Golang (Gin/Fiber) for the backend and Next.js (TypeScript) for the frontend, it's deployed on Vercel/Render.
